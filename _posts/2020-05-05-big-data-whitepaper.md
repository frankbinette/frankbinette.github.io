title: An Old Big Data Whitepaper
---

### Context

Back in 2017, the marketing department where I'm working asked me if I would like to write a whitepaper. Being recently hired as a big data solution engineer, I wanted to share what I've learned in France to make sure Montreal's enterprises don't fall into the obvious pitfalls I've witnessed with earlier adopters. We also wanted to use it as a marketing tool to expose our expertise, as the majority of whitepapers try to do. At the time, and still today, whitepapers are mainly written by manufacturers who want to sell their technology as being the best one for whatever trending terms. Back then it was all about "big data" but now it's all about "artificial intelligence". 

I won't start a long rant about how "AI" is overused and often misleading because I felt for "big data" eight years ago. I used to be naive, I still am, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndBjraV-3UY" target="_blank">but i used to too</a>. But anyway, this whitepaper aimed at grooming mainly non-tech specialists, business lines, executives, on how to start a big data initiative, find the right reasons, and understand what it emplies. An introduction to a broad subject.

I could eventually revise it, critique it, and call out any BS I may have written. I tried to be honest, transparent, and not play with the truth but hey, maybe I embellished it a bit!

### About the title

Since the early days of the big data craze, I've seen so many "demystify this", "demystify that", it's getting old. You still see webinars, whitepapers, blog posts with this title. I have a problem with this term. First, because it's almost always a clickbait title where you won't demystify something beacuse it's simply a product presentation. And second, because it implies that technology is mysterious, like magic. Technology is not mysterious, one either knows what it is and how it works, or it doesn't. I don't know how black holes are materialized but I won't call them mysterious. It may be difficult to grasp for the uninitiated but still, there is no magic, man.

I didn't want to use this term, but unfortunately, the majority associates it with something that will help them understand a difficult topic, like a tutorial, something like "let me take your hand and show you how it works" even if it's not always true. So how do I use it without using it? We came up with this title, originally written in French, and translated to English.

The objective was to make it catchy without being clickbaity, attractive without over-marketingizing it, aiming at the right people (non-tech) without losing them with the content, making sure they learn something from the content. Do I still like it a couple of years later? Yeah, it's alright. I'm more critique of the content. &#128562;

### About the content

Writing quality content is hard, especially for novice writers, which I am. You may estimate it will take 40 hours to write a whitepaper, but it will take way more than that, like 200! While juggling with regular work, it took me a good 6 months to complete. It's like a thesis, your don't just write, you research, read, rewrite, interview, wonder where you left off before having to do something else for the past week, reread your work and then delete everything because you don't remember where you were going with that. Classic stuff.

My objectives were to make the reader understand:
1. What is "big data", why does it exist now, what does it imply, etc.
2. How can it tangibly improve its business (hint: make more money or spend less money)
3. How to identify business needs with a simple methodology
4. How big data use cases can answer these business needs

The main pitfall I wanted to expose was the major mistake of investing in big data technologies (like Hadoop) without having any business use cases that need big data technology. I've seen many enterprises invest in Hadoop without really knowing what to do with it just because it was hype. People tend to forget that you don't buy a car if you have nowhere to go or don't know how to drive. My thinking was if I show you some interesting destinations that could improve your life, then, maybe it could be a good idea to buy a car to go to these places and reap some benefits. This applies to any technology but that's another subject.

I think I achieved my objectives by distilling theses subjects in a logical sequence for non-tech peoples. The methodology can still be used for a BI or analytics initiative, but that's also another subject. Still, it feels a bit bland. Maybe I'm a bit too hard with myself. #noregerts

It was ambitious to cover everything mentioned above, maybe a bit naive. I used to joke that it would be more an ebook than a whitepaper, which generally is between 3 and 8 pages. The edited version (post graphic design) is 22 pages, which is a long whitepaper but not an ebook.

### Reflecting on the experience

Did we achieve our objective of exposure? Well, kind of, I'm not sure. I'm still trying to get the stats on how many times it has been downloaded. I'll update if I get the numbers. And the difficult question: did we get business out of this? I got a temporary contract with a client but not because I wrote a whitepaper. So, not really. Pepehands. Put simply, the majority of our clients are not the target market for big data technologies. As simple as that.

The subject of big data was kind of new in Quebec, I would even say in Canada in general as we tend to be laggards when it comes to technologies. I'm not talking about startups, but traditional enterprises like banks, or SMEs that are still trying to tackle digital transformation which often means buying their first ERP! Canada is also a small market compared to France (I would say an early majority adopter) and the US (an early adopter since they started it). Being a small market doesn't mean we don't use innovative technologies, but big data technologies were developed to tackle the data deluge and a small market doesn't produce a deluge of data. It's my simplest explanation without getting into too many details.

One day I could re-write the whitepaper, or just write something else. Is big data even a thing anymore? Yes, it is, it's just not at the forefront anymore and the technologies have changed (where is my boy Hadoop?!) If I was opportunistic, I would simply change the title to "AI for business: how to use it to your advantage" and change a couple of use cases and there we go, we're AI specialists now!
