<p>Why Frank Binette? It sounds good, sounds international, sounds like a rockstar! But yeah, the name is Fran√ßois Vienneau Binette which can be a mouthful for non-French-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>I'm a Canadian data dude who started his career playing with Hadoop and is now doing analytics engineering with cool cloud technologies. I enjoy data warehousing, modeling, and visualization.</p>

<p>Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fvbinette/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankbinette">GitHub</a>, even <a href="https://twitter.com/frankbinette">Twitter</a> (but rarely there.)</p>
